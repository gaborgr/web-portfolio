            In 2023, I decided it was time for a professional change—to pursue
            what truly inspires me. Transitioning from the financial sector to
            software development hasn’t been easy, but the drive to follow my
            passion has fueled my commitment. In May, I made the bold decision
            to dedicate myself entirely to this journey, immersing myself in
            learning, practicing, and building skills in software development.
          </p>
          <p class="text-description">
            I’ve taken a self-taught approach, investing countless hours in
            understanding programming fundamentals and the logic behind various
            technologies. My focus has been on truly comprehending the "why" and
            "how" of programming processes, rather than simply memorizing
            commands. This approach has helped me build a strong foundation and
            a flexible mindset, which I believe are key to thriving in the tech
            industry
          </p>
          <p class="text-description">
            I began with Python, a language I found intuitive and powerful. Once
            I understood its logic and how it manages information flow, I
            discovered that learning additional programming languages became
            progressively easier. I’ve also explored JavaScript, a language I
            admire for its versatility, particularly in web and mobile
            application development. My goal is to refine my JavaScript skills
            through upcoming projects and further dive into the dynamic
            interplay between front-end and back-end technologies.
          </p>
          <p class="text-description">
            Another area I’m excited to explore is
            <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>. With its rapid
            advancement and widespread adoption, it’s clear that AI will shape
            the future of technology. I see AI as an incredibly powerful and
            useful tool—one that every tech professional should understand. The
            ability to create systems capable of self-learning and evolving
            eliminates the need for constant code rewriting to update
            information, making it an indispensable asset. While I’ve had a
            brief introduction to Machine Learning during my Python studies, I
            recognize the need to deepen my knowledge in this field to
            effectively harness its potential and contribute to innovative
            solutions.
          </p>
          <p class="text-description">
            Currently, I am preparing to obtain the
            <strong>AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner – Foundational</strong>
            certification. Cloud technologies fascinate me because of their
            efficiency and scalability, which align with my financial
            perspective of optimizing cost-benefit ratios for companies.
          </p>
          <p class="text-description">
            Looking ahead, I plan to expand my knowledge into technologies such
            as React, TypeScript, and Java, which I see as essential for
            achieving my ultimate goal: becoming a proficient Software Engineer.
            I understand that this role demands not just technical expertise but
            also the ability to integrate and adapt to various technologies—a
            challenge I am eager to embrace.
          </p>
          <p class="text-description">
            This journey is just beginning, and I am committed to continuous
            learning, taking each step as an opportunity to grow and build a
            career where I can create, innovate, and contribute meaningfully to
            the tech world.
