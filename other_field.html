            Before deciding to pivot my career towards technology, I studied
            Public Accounting in Venezuela, completing a rigorous five-year
            program. This education gave me a deep understanding of the
            financial world, including management control, company production
            processes, cost optimization, and the analysis of expenses and
            revenues. Over the years, I’ve worked in various roles across
            different companies, accumulating extensive experience in
            administration and finance.
          </p>
          <p class="text-description">
            While this background may not directly relate to software
            development, I firmly believe that every skill and knowledge I’ve
            gained can be applied to any field. My financial experience has
            taught me to approach challenges with a holistic perspective,
            considering processes not just in isolation but as interconnected
            parts of a greater system working toward a common goal.
          </p>
          <p class="text-description">
            I graduated in 2006 with a degree in Public Accounting and have
            since applied my education in real-world scenarios while gaining
            valuable lessons beyond the classroom. I’ve held roles ranging from
            Assistant and Analyst to leadership positions such as Supervisor and
            Department Head. These roles allowed me to grow professionally, and
            while I could continue in this field, my true passion lies in
            technology.
          </p>
          <p class="text-description">
            During my financial journey, I had the privilege of working with
            renowned companies such as:
          </p>
          <p class="text-description">
            <li>
              <strong>KPMG</strong>, a global leader in consulting and financial
              process auditing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>UNILEVER</strong>, a major producer of consumer goods.
            </li>
            <li><strong>BUPA</strong>, a medical services company.</li>
            <li><strong>GL Events</strong>, a service-oriented company.</li>
          </p>
          <p class="text-description">
            Each of these experiences had a common thread: improving processes,
            optimizing costs, and maximizing outcomes. These goals not only
            shaped my approach to work but also taught me transferable skills,
            such as:
          </p>
          <p class="text-description">
            <li>
              <strong>Data analysis and decision-making.</strong>

            <li>
              <strong>Team collaboration and leadership.</strong>

            <li>
              <strong>Information flow management.</strong>

              <strong>Procedure creation and standardization.</strong>

            One of the accomplishments I’m most proud of is establishing an
            entire accounting department from scratch. I was entrusted to build
            a team, design procedures, and align them with corporate standards.
            Another highlight was overseeing the migration from one accounting
            system to a newer platform—a complex task that required meticulous
            planning to maintain the accuracy and integrity of financial data.
            Additionally, I played a key role in launching a production plant,
            handling complex cost analysis for raw materials and finished goods
            to ensure the project’s success.
          </p>
          <p class="text-description">
            These experiences have not only strengthened my professional
            expertise but also given me confidence in my ability to adapt, lead,
            and contribute in any environment.
